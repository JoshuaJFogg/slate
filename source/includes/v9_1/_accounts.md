# Accounts

The below section describes all actions available against an account within the eSuite platform. An account is a fundamental requirement for a customer. Without an account, there is no mechanism to make a purchase or check access. 

Once an account has been created on the eSuite platform, all endpoints listed below become available for use. An account can have additional meta-data added to it, using Custom Account Parameters; if you would like any additional fields adding to an account profile, please contact our customer support team.
