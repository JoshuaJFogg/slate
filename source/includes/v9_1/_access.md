# Access

eSuite provides the functionality to grant or deny access to a specific piece of content, using Entitlements. 

Entitlements can be assigned to an end-user either via a purchase or directly on the account via customer support. When an entitlement is added to the account it will have three key pieces of information.

Firstly, an EntitlementIdentifier is required and this is what an API request would need to pass in to understand whether the end-user has access to the content. The second piece of information is the start date because entitlements are only active during a period that has been defined by you as the company. The final piece is the expiry date, which determines when the end-user loses access to content.
