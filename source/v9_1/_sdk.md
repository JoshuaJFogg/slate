# SDK

The eSuite SDK is a client-side application written in Angular JS. In order to perform a user journey for purchasing a product or a service, an eSuite session is required. An eSuite session can be gained in one of two ways. 

The first is via a GET request, which will provide a session with a number of predefined values set against it for the product or service, the customer would like to purchase. Secondly, If you would like more control over the details of the session, a call server-to-serve is required to configure a more advanced session.
