# Purchasing

Purchasing via the eSuite platform can be split into distinctive types:
### Subscriptions
The purchase of subscriptions is performed using a ServicePriceId to identify which price and currency the customer would like to purchase. A subscription can be purchased over a number of different periods e.g. Daily, Monthly, Annually. 
### Products
Similar to subscriptions, a product is a one-off purchase and uses an identifier to identify which price and currency the customer would like to purchase the item. Unlike a subscription, there is not duration option against a product.
### Miscellaneous charges
This type of purchase is focused solely on the information about what is being purchased being held outside of eSuite. This is typically a payment that needs to be made in order to grant access to a different system or to clear an outstanding balance.
### Payment Instructions
A payment instruction is the concept of a schedule of payments being created that will be completed over a given period. Unlike other purchase option, payment instructions use a cart of items in order to define what the end-user would like to purchase and in which currency.
