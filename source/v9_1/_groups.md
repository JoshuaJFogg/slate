# Groups

Groups in eSuite, as used as a mechanism of grouping a number of individual accounts together with the purpose of creating either a family or corporate account. A group account allows you to purchase a subscription and assign it to multiple members of the account group.

Access to the account group can be restricted by IP address and/or email domain. 

Using an account group prevents your employees or family members purchasing their own individual subscriptions.
